This is a template for a simple cross-server communication bot! To use, simply paste your token into it's place (in main.py) and run.

This comes with a few commands that require admin use only, but I'm not clever enough to find out permissions, so I've got them set to my own ID. You can change this to a list of other valid IDs yourself.

This uses environment variables to store a token, as this was created on replit, where it was publicly available. You can change the token to whatever in line 252 of main.py
